## Website

Game can be played on index.html. This comes with the [dist](./dist) folder---
that way the game is playable from GItHub pages---so you don't have to build
anything if you want to play locally. If you do want to build, use  one of the 
following commands:


```bash
bun run build # Build once for debug
bun run prod  # Build once for production, minifies
bun run watch # Build as you save files while developing
```

## Server

The server can be called to find the most point solutions for an input level.
